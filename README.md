 🏠 SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship – Task 01

This repository contains my completed submission for Task 01 of the SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship, where I implemented a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on property features.
 📌 Problem Statement

Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses using the following features:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

Dataset: Provided by SkillCraft under the "House Price Dataset" category.

📊 Workflow Summary

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Checked and handled missing values  
   - Data type correction  
   - Outlier detection and handling  

2.  Data Analysis 
   - Used visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps)  
   - Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable   

3. Model Building
   - Trained a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`  
   - Fitted on the processed dataset  

4. Model Evaluation
   - Used the following metrics to evaluate the model:  
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
     - R² Score  
 🧠 Key Learnings

- End-to-end understanding of regression modeling
- Data visualization and correlation analysis
- Evaluation of model performance with regression-specific metrics
- Real-world application of ML to housing price prediction
